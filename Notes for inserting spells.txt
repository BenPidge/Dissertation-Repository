Press run and enter 1 to enter spells.

The spells range has to JUST be an integer, use 0 if it says 'self'.
The area is normally in brackets after the range. Enter the value if it shows a circle, or the value
and "ft cone" or "ft line", depending on the shape. if it has none, press enter with NO text(not even spaces)
Make sure to look for dice, then enter it like "2d6 necrotic" for 2d6 of necrotic damage.
For the description, do not include the spaces after the final fullstop. If a spell description has
paragraphs, copy it line/paragraph by line, and write "\n" between each, with no spaces before or after.

Only do the 1st level spells, in alphabetical order. As it's a database, there can be NO ERRORS AT ALL.
Any small error could render a spell useless.
Typing 'N' when it asks if you want another saves your progress, and the red square cancels without saving.
I'd recommend pressing 'N' and rerunning every 3 or so spells so mistakes aren't too bad. If you make
a mistake, press the red square, then the green triangle and re-enter any you did the last run.

There's £5 for every 10 spells available, which gives you a potential £30 for all 1st level spells. 
Please let me know when you're going to do some more so I don't edit the database at the same time and lose data -
I cba setting up concurrent insertions. I'll show you how to send me the stuff but you can always just tell me.
